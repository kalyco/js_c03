#Constructor Notation

###Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things.
###Object constuctors can use a function as a template for creating objects.
###First, create the template with the objects properties and methods.

###You create *instances* of the object using the constructor function.
###The *new* keyword followed by a call to the function creates a new object.
###The properties of each object are given as arguments to the function.
