#DECLARING A FUNCTION

###To create a function you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a function declaration.

####declare a function by using the **function** keyword.

####function sayHello() {
####  document.write('Hello!');
####}

####sayHello();


##There is a subtle difference between **parameters** and **arguments**.
##params can act like variables when a method id called. Arguments are manually ##passed in code that is needed to call the function.
